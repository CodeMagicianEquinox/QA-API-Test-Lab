# 🧪 QA API Test Suite

An end-to-end REST API test lab built and automated by me to showcase QA engineering skills.  

This project demonstrates black-box testing, API validation, automation workflows, and live test reporting — all powered by Python and hosted via GitHub Pages.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- 🐍 **Python 3.x** — Scripting and test logic  
- 🧪 **Pytest** — Test framework  
- 🌐 **Requests** — HTTP client for REST calls  
- 🖥️ **Bash CLI** — Automation and test execution  
- 🗂️ **Git + GitHub** — Version control + code hosting  
- 🕸️ **GitHub Pages** — Hosting for the HTML-based test report viewer  

---

## 📋 Test Cases

The suite uses `pytest` to perform automated testing against [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com), a free fake REST API for prototyping and testing.

| Endpoint             | Test Description                  |
|----------------------|------------------------------------|
| `/users`             | Validate status and response shape |
| `/users/{id}`        | Parametrized test for known users  |
| `/users/999`         | Check behavior on invalid user ID  |

- Parametrized test coverage  
- CLI automation with `pytest`  
- Dynamic test report viewer in the browser  
- Clean UI built with HTML + JavaScript  
- Fully hosted on GitHub (code + demo)

## 💻 Built From Scratch

Every aspect of this lab — from backend testing logic to the live frontend interface — was created by me.

✅ Authored all Python-based API test scripts  
✅ Handled test orchestration and automation  
✅ Developed the web interface with HTML and JavaScript  
✅ Deployed the project using GitHub Pages to simulate a live QA workflow

## 📌 Notes

- All tests use live public endpoints, so the lab is runnable without setup.

- This repo is intentionally designed to mimic a QA Engineer workflow — from test case to visual reporting.
